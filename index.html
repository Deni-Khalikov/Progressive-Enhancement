        <p class="bold">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around
            to commiserate. They said,

            <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>. The
            farmer said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong></q>.The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with
            it,
            and in the evening
            everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
            The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong></q> </p1>



        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell
            whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good"> good</em> or <em class="bad"> bad</em> — because
            you
            never know what will be the consequence of the
            misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good"> good</em> fortune.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's
        not make a big deal out of it...</p>
